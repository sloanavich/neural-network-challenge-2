        "1. Accuracy is useful but may not be the best standalone metric, especially for the attrition prediction. If the dataset is imbalanced (e.g., many more “No Attrition” than “Yes”), accuracy can be misleading. In such cases, precision, recall, or F1-score might give a better picture of how well the model handles the minority class. For department prediction, accuracy is more reliable because it’s a multi-class problem and class balance may vary by dataset.\n",
        "2. I used softmax activation for both output layers. Softmax is ideal for classification problems with mutually exclusive classes and one-hot encoded labels. It turns the output into a probability distribution across the classes, which works well for both the multi-class department prediction and the binary attrition prediction (which was also one-hot encoded into two columns).\n",
        "3. Yes. Some ways to improve the model include:\n",
        "\t•\tPerforming hyperparameter tuning (adjusting layer sizes, number of layers, batch size, learning rate, etc.)\n",
        "\t•\tAdding dropout or regularization to prevent overfitting\n",
        "\t•\tUsing class weights or resampling to handle potential class imbalance\n",
